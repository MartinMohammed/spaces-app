### General Explanation of the Application

- The application is a React single-page application.
- Users have the ability to upload their travel experiences.
- User experiences are stored inside AWS S3 & DynamoDB.
- When users log in, they can access their uploaded experiences.

### Disclaimer

The primary focus of this application was not to build a sophisticated frontend application. Instead, the main emphasis was placed on developing a robust and scalable cloud infrastructure.

The key goals for the application were:

- **Scalability**: Designing the infrastructure to handle varying workloads and accommodate future growth seamlessly.

- **Durability**: Ensuring that data and resources are stored securely and with high durability, minimizing the risk of data loss.

- **Availability**: Implementing measures to maintain high availability and minimize downtime for users.

While the frontend serves as a functional interface, the main achievement lies in creating a reliable and efficient cloud infrastructure capable of meeting the outlined goals.
